            <h2>Understanding Star Wars RPG Characters</h2>
            <p>The Star Wars RPG (using Fantasy Flight Games' system) creates characters through a unique combination of <strong>Species</strong>, <strong>Career</strong>, and <strong>Specializations</strong>. Unlike traditional class-based systems, Star Wars RPG allows for incredible flexibility while maintaining the iconic archetypes that make the galaxy far, far away so compelling.</p>

            <h3>The Three Pillars of Character Creation</h3>
            <p>Every Star Wars character is built on three core elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Species:</strong> Your biological heritage - Human, Twi'lek, Wookiee, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Career:</strong> Your background and general profession - Smuggler, Diplomat, Bounty Hunter</li>
                <li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Your specific focus within that career - Pilot, Ambassador, Assassin</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
            <p>Think of Star Wars character creation like choosing a profession in our world. Your species is like your cultural background - it influences how you see the world and what advantages you might have. Your career is your general field - like "military" or "entertainment." Your specialization is your specific job within that field - like "fighter pilot" or "musician." Just as a military communications specialist and a military medic have different skills despite the same career background, Star Wars specializations provide focused abilities within broader career paths.</p>

            <h3>The Role of the Force</h3>
            <p>Force sensitivity is a special characteristic that can be added to any character concept. Force-sensitive characters have access to Force powers and can develop along Jedi or Sith paths, but they can also be smugglers, diplomats, or any other career who happen to have a connection to the Force.</p>

            <h2>Character Creation Process</h2>
            <p>Creating a Star Wars character involves balancing mechanical effectiveness with compelling narrative hooks that fit the space opera genre.</p>
